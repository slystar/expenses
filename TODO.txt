    - Test migration
	- test in rake task to make sure mappings remain, stores, etc

- do we need a process_flag on user_payment?
- how to handle returns (ex: you return something to the store after it's
  been processed)
- expense history (user_id, expense_id, group_id), could allow group deletion
    - possibly use papertrail gem

Backups:
- put backing up code in model?
