Models:
- add previous_user_balance_id column to user_balance model and track history
- add a user_balance_history table that would tack each "update_balances",
  that id could be kept in expenses, user_dept, user_payment and user_balance
  to group them by "update_balances"
- import csv from bank
- check indexes
- expense history (user_id, expense_id, group_id), could allow group
  deletion

Backups:
- put backing up code in model?
